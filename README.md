This is a small website I made that showcases a lightsaber you can turn on and off, and you also have six colors to change the lightsaber to.
I made this back in November of 2023; it was a nice and fun project to work on, and this time I didn't watch any tutorials or anythingâ€”just me and my knowledge.
I also used a little JavaScript for the functionality, and I have made it open-source so that any other new programmer who wants to learn or copy can do so.
The first best thing to do is to make something; the second best is to share it, which is what I believe.
I hope you guys like it. Thank you!
